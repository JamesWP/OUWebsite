These images are taken by a reflecting telescope on a computerised mount which rotates at the same speed as the earth, and a DSLR connected using a simple adapter. 
This is by no means a advanced setup but does take some surprising images, even in a light polluted area. Not all Astrophotography requires a telescope, 
some stunning pictures can be taken of star trails with a Camera (A camera which the shutter can be locked open) and some patience.
